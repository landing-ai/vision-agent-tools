# Vision tools

This repository contains tools to solve your vision problems. These tools can be used
in conjunction with the [vision-agent](https://github.com/landing-ai/vision-agent).

# Getting started

## Installation
You can install by running `poetry install --extras "all"` to install all tools, or with
`poetry install --extras "owlv2 florencev2"` to install specific tools such as `owlv2`
and `florencev2`.

## Usage
Here's a simple example of how to use the `OwlV2` tool to detect objects in an image:
```python
from PIL import Image
from vision_agent_tools.tools.owlv2 import OwlV2

# load image
image = Image.open("/path/to/my/image.png")
model = Owlv2()

detections = model(image=image, prompts=["cat"])
```

# Contributing

## Clone the repo and install it

```bash
poetry install
poetry run pre-commit install
```

## Adding new tool code

Tools can be added in `vision_agent_tools/tools`. Simply create a new python file with
the tool name and add a class with the same name. The class should inherit from
`BaseTool` and implement the `__call__` method. Here's a simplified example for adding
Owlv2 from the transformers library:

```python
from Image import Image
from vision_agent_tools.base_tool import BaseTool
from transformers import Owlv2Processor, Owlv2ForObjectDetection

class Owlv2(BaseTool):
    def __init__(self):
        self.processor = Owlv2Processor.from_pretrained("google/owlv2-base-patch16-ensemble")
        self.model = Owlv2ForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("google/owlv2-base-patch16-ensemble")

    def __call__(self, image: Image.Image, prompt: list[str]):
        inputs = self.processor(image, [prompt], return_tensors="pt")
        outputs = self.model(**inputs)
        target_sizes = torch.Tensor(image.size[::-1])
        results = self.processor.post_process_object_detection(outputs, target_sizes=target_sizes, threshold=0.1)
        output = []
        for box, score, label in zip(resuts[0]["boxes"], results[0]["scores"], results[0]["labels"]):
            output.append({"box": box.tolist()), "score": score.item(), "label": label.item()}
        return output
```

## Adding new dependencies
Afer that you can add the dependencies as optional like so:

```bash
poetry add transformers --optional
```

After adding each dependency, you need to go to the `pyproject.toml` file and add a new
group under `[tool.poetry.extras]`. This will allow the installation of the package with
specific tools.
```toml
[tool.poetry.extras]
all = ["transformers"]
owlv2 = ["transformers"]
```

Here we've added `"transformers"` as the dependency for the `owlv2` group. With these
you can now install just tools you need by running:
```bash
poetry install -E "owlv2"
```

or installing everything with:
```bash
poetry install -E "all"
```
